# Image_style_transfer-using-cyceGAN
The primary goal of the Image Style Transfer project was to create a system capable of transforming images from one style to another using CycleGAN (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks).

Data Collection-> Used CycleGAN as we had no paired training set available-> Training and Evaluation -> deployed it on hugging face spaces
